# Repository for final project
In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application. This project was done in Coursera Lab and will be unable to be communicate with Watson anywhere else.

Files __init__.py, emotion_detection.py, server.py, and test_emotion_detection.py were done by me following the requistes of the final project for the "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask" Coursera course.
